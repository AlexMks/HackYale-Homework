					<h2>Ballroom Dancing</h2>
					<p><a href="http://www.yaleballroom.org" target="_blank">The Yale Ballroom Dance Team</a> has seen me through all four years at Yale.  After joining without any dance experience, I now compete at the Gold-level in Latin and Rhythm!  I also served as Treasurer of the team my junior year, which taught me about accounting for and helping coordinate a large organization.  My partner and I travel around the Northeast with the rest of the team to compete, and occasionally perform choreographed pieces at Yale.  The world of ballroom is fascinating, addicting to watch, and has its own fair share of drama.</p>

					<h3>Websites I think are cool</h3>
					<dl>
						<dt>DigitasLBi is an online advertising and marketing firm.  Its main website stands out thanks to its compelling and intuitive design</dt>
							<dd><a href="http://http://www.digitas.com/" target="_blank">www.digitas.com</a></dd>
						<dt>99%Invisible is a rapidly up-and-coming design blog.  Of course, its innovative and convenient controls make it fun to use.</dt>
							<dd><a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/" target="_block">99percentinvisible.org</a></dd>
						<dt>5 Chapters is not remarkable for its design principles, but for its twist on storytelling.  It publishes a short story each week, splitting each story's five chapters over five weekdays, and reminiscing on a serial model of publishing that existed and went obsolete long before the internet.</dt>
