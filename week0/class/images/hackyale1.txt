Anatomy of a Webpage
Web Developer wants to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript
- HTML = bones of website, the bones
- CSS = "Cascading Style Sheets," the skin of physical features of the internet
       Easy to learn...difficult to master
       The web designer's best friend
- Javascript = the "muscles"
	The "interaction" or "animation" of the internet

A webpage is a collection of boxes, and boxes in boxes

The Four Ingredients of Webpages: Text, Images, Links, and Input

HTML: THE CONCEPT
- Nesting
	- Like an essay ooutline
- Tags <html> a tag is the opening of a box.  Closing the box is </html>

TAGS
	Tags have properties which are then passed onto the content within the tags

	What is div?

EVERY PAGE YOU TYPE HAS:
 !DOCTYPE HTML
 Open HTML Tag
 Open and CLose Head tag
 Open Body Tag
 Close Body Tag
 Close HTML Tag

WHAT IS THE HEAD TAG FOR?
	Metadata: data about the website.  it's not stuff that goes on your website.  The title would go into the head tag.

If the line of code is less than 80 characters, it's ok to keep it on one line.  But don't.

POPULAR TAGS
	<div>an arbitrary division that sets off a section of your page</div>
	<a>"anchor" links.  They are your links to other pages</a>
	<img>  the image tag has no closing tag.  You can't really nest things inside an image...  You insert the image url in the tag.
	<p> For typing lines of text<p>

attributes
     <tag name="value" name2="value">
	name = name of the attribute.
	value = the value you would like the attribute to have
	EX. <a href="url">url link</a>

You can make the image into a link!!!

When linking to an image stored on your computer, start not with an http://, but with a .  (a dot) that means get the image from the current folder location on your computer, and then trace the direction of the object in your file directory.

THE INTERNET
	the internet is a wire that connects a huge neighborhood, or really, a huge branching wire going to a great number of addresses.


CLient-server model
	Client = (you and your) browser, who are being served
	Server = the machine sending (or "serving") you the data and files you request
	Host ~= "server"
		To "host" files means to be a server
	Local = hosted on the machine in question
	Remote = hosted on a different machine

REQUEST RESPONSE CYCLE
1. CLient (browser) makes a "request".
	A request is a textual mewssage whose syntax and semantics are defined by HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The request is for HTML, CSS, JS, Image, Document, etc. Think of a protocol as a "language"

2. The Server issues a response
	The response is a textual message defined by HTTP
		Contains content
		
		and/or status code. 
			404 = "not found"
			200 = "Okay!"
			500 = internal server error

	Server coding and languages include PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

3. This cycle repeats itself
